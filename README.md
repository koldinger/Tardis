Tardis-Backup
=============
A Time Machine style backup system.

Tardis is a system for making incremental backups of filesystems, much like Apple's TimeMachine.

Like TimeMachine, Tardis is aimed primarily at "live backups", namely a backup taken periodically, and available for quick recovery, typically stored on attached or online disks, or rather than being stored on archival backup media, such as tapes.

Tardis runs in a client/server mode, or in a fully local mode.   

Quick Start
===========
Installation
------------
* Pick machines to use as both your client and server.   They can be the same machine, but if you want to backup to your client machine, it is recommended that you backup to a drive that you only use for backups, so that a failure of your main drive(s) will not cause a loss of your backups.
* Install the tardis package on your client and server machines.
  * `pip install .`
  * Sometimes this fails, complaining about requests not being available.  If so, just rerun it, and it should work the second time.
  * If this doesn't work, you may need to install additional packages that this installer can't.   See the [Installation](#Installation) section below for more details.
* Edit the daemon configuration file to indicate where you want to store the backups.   The configuration is stored (on linux) in `/etc/tardis/tardisd.cfg`, the database base directory is specified in the `BaseDir` option.   By default, the location is `/media/Backup/tardis`
* Start the server:  `tardisd --config /etc/tardis/tardisd.config`

Backing up data
---------------
* Run the first backup job `tardis --server ServerName --create paths` where ServerName is the name of the server (if backing up to the local machine, this can be localhost, or the --server option can be left of entirely), and paths is a list of directories to backup (including all directories below them).   Depending on the amount of data you wish to backup, this can take a long time.
  * Adding the --password option will cause your backups to be encrypted.
   * With no password specified, you will be prompted to enter one.
   * you can also specify the --password-file and --password-prog to retrieve the password from a file, or from a program.
   * DO NOT LOSE YOUR PASSWORD.   There is no recovery mechanism.
  * Adding the --progress option will show progress as your backup runs, but is not recommended for automated backups.
* When the first job completes correctly, you can run subsequent backups using the same command line, but removing the --create option.  `tardis --server ServerName paths`
  * If the first run doesn't complete successfully, subsequent runs without --create will simply move to complete the partial backup.
  * Creating a periodic job (such as daily or hourly) via cron can automate your backups.
  
Each time you run the tardis program, you will create a new backup set.  By default backup sets are named Monthly-YYYY-MM for the first backup set stored in any month, Weekly-YYYY-WW for the first backup set any week (if not a monthly set), Daily-YYYY-MM-DD for the first set each day (unless weekly or monthly), and Hourly-YYYY-MM-DD-hh if run hourly.  Additional backup sets (ie, more than hourly), or incomplete backup sets (where the tardis job failed before the backup completed) are named Backup_YYYY-MM-DD-hh:mm:ss. (YYYY = year, MM = month, DD = date, WW = week of year, hh = hour, mm = min, and ss = seconds).
Normally, hourly backups are pruned out of the database after 24 hours, daily sets after 30 days, weekly after 6 months, and monthly's kept forever.  All these names and pruning parameters can be adjusted.

Recovering data
---------------
There are two ways to access backed up data, and it depends how you've done your backup.  If you've backed your data 
up to the client machine, you can access the backup database directly.  In this case you will point tools directly
at the database.   This can also be done if the database is accesible via a network file system, such as NFS or Samba/SMB/CIFS.   If the backup drive is not directly accessible, it can be reached via an http exposed filesystem.  Details on setting this up are below.

* Determine which backup sets exist:  `sonic list --database DatabasePath`.
  * DatabasePath could be a path on your local system, if you're using the system above, usually the same value you entered in the tardisd config file, so `sonic list --database /media/Backup/tardis`.   If you're using a remote system, it will be an HTTP (or HTTPS) URL, eg `sonic list --database http://serverhost` where serverhost is the name of the machine running the server.
  * If the backups were made with a password, the password will need to be specified via the --password or related options.  You will be prompted for a password if one isn't specified. 
* Determine which version of the file are available using the lstardis program: `lstardis --databse DatabasePath /path/to/file`.  This will list all the backup sets which contain changed versions of the file.
* Recover the file using the regenerate program: `regenerate --database DatabasePath --backup backupset /path/to/file`.  This will recover the versino of the file in backupset.  If the file is a directory, the directory, and all files below it will be recovered.   You can specify the -o option to indicate where the files should be recovered.   You can also replace --backup with --date Date to recover the most recent version backed up before Date.   If you don't specify a backupset or date, the most recent version will be recovered.

Tardis File System
------------------
The tardis dataset can also be mounted as a filesystem.   Typically the command: `tardisfs --database DatabasePath /path/to/mountpoint` will mount the filesystem under the directory /path/to/mountpoint (mountpoint should be an empty directory).  In this scenario, you will see files under mountpoint.   At the first level, there will be a directory for each backup set, with the names as above.   Within each directory will be a directory tree, with the data as backed up in that backup set.


Local and Remote Backups
------------------------
The Tardis client (tardis) can be run in either a client/server (remote) or directly against a backup database (local) mode.

In the remote mode, there must be a backup server running, typically on a remote machine.   In the local mode, no server is used, and data is backed up to a drive connected to the
machine being backed up, either physically or via a network share.

Normally, the mode will be selected by the switches, and various config options.  If a server is specified (via --server, the TARDIS_SERVER environment variable, or a configuration file), remote mode will
be picked.   If a database is specified (via the --database/-D option, the TARDIS_DATABASE environment variable, or a configuration file), local mode will be selected.    In some circumstances, you can create a confusing situation, such as having
both the TARDIS_SERVER and TARDIS_DATABASE environment variables set.  In this case, use either the --local or --remote options to select local or remote mode, respectively.

Components
==========
Tardis consists of several components:
* tardisd (Daemon.py): The tardis daemon process which maintains the backups
* tardis  (Client.py): The tardis client process, which creates backup data and pushes it to the server
* tardisfs (TardisFS.py): A FUSE based file system which provides views of the various backup sets.
* regenerate (Regenerate.py): A program to retrieve an individual verson of the file without using the TardisFS
* lstardis (List.py): List versions of files and directories in the database.
* tardiff (Diff.py): Show the differences between versions of backed up files, and the current version.
* sonic (Sonic.py): An administration tool, allowing things like setting and changing passwords, removing backup sets, purging orphans, etc.
* tardisremote (HttpInterface): An optional http server which provides a web api for retrieving information in the tardis database, for use by regenerate, tardisfs, and lstardis, etc.

Tardis is written in Python 3, and only relies on a few non-pure python packages.

Tardis uses a modified version of the librsync library, which adapts it to support he most recent versions of librsync.
When/if a correct functional version appears on Pypi, we'll use it instead.  See https://github.com/smartfile/python-librsync

Tardis also comes with a number of "tools", which are not necessarily fully supported:
* checkdb.py: Check that the database makes sense, to some degree.
* encryptDB.py: Encrypt a backup database.
* decryptName.py: Decrypt (or encrypt) a name as specified in the database.
* cdfile.py: Give the full path of a file in the backup database.
* mkKeyBackup.py: Generate a backup copy of your keys, suitable for hardcopy printing and archiving.
Tools are located in the tools directory, and are not installed.

Future Releases
===============
Several releases will be coming soon:
  * 1.2.0 Integrated backend with frontend for local backups.
  * 1.3.0 Asynchronous protocol allowing improved performance, and improved integration between client and server for local cases.

Server Setup
============
  * Edit the config file, /etc/tardis/tardisd.cfg
      * Set the BaseDir variable to point at a location to store all your databases.
      * Set the Port to be the port you want to use.  Default is currently 7420.
  * If you want to use SSL, create a certificate and a key file (plenty of directions on the web).
  * Edit other parameters as necessary.
  * Create your backup directory, if need by (mkdir */path/to/your/backup/directory*)
  * Add a tardis user (adduser tardis)
  * Create a log directory (mkdir */var/log/tardisd*)
  * Copy the appropriate startup script as desired
      * Systemd/systemctl based systems
         * Debian based systems:
             * `cp init/debian/tardisd.service /usr/lib/systemd/system`
         * Other systems (such as Fedora):
             * `cp init/other/tardisd.service /usr/lib/systemd/system`
         * `systemctl enable tardisd.service`
         * start the service

           * `service tardisd start`
     * Repeat the process with the tardisremote scripts, if you wish to support accessing the database via the remote (http) protocol.

Server Requirements
-------------------
The server should run on any system running Linux.  Fedora, Ubuntu, and Raspbian have all been used successfully

It does not need to be particularly powerful.  A Raspberry Pi Model B has been used, but is a bit underpowered.  A Raspberry Pi 2 Model B seems to work quite well, primarily due to the larger memory.

Typically, a faster processor and more memory will lead to shorter backup times, as will faster I/O connections to the disk drives.  On a benchmark system, a Raspberry Pi server would run a backup in about 40-50 minutes, a Raspberry Pi 2 will reduce that time to under 30 minutes, and a dual core 1.5GHz Celeron (with 4GB of memory, and USB 3.0 disk drives) will run the benchmark in 3-5 minutes.  

Running the Client
==================
Should probably run as root.  Basic operation is thus:
  tardis [--port <targetPort>] [--server <host>] /path/to/directory-to-backup <more paths here>
If you wish encrypted backups, add a password (via the --password, --password-file, or --password-prog options) to enable encryption.  Note that passwords can be added at a later point, and the database encrypted at that point, but it is a very slow operation.

On your first backup, add the --create flag to initialize the backup set.
Your first backup will take quite a while.  Subsequent backups will be significantly faster.
If the first backup does not complete, it can be continued simply by using the same command line, without the --create option.
It will backup any data which wasn't backed up the first time, along with any changed data.   This can be repeated any number of times.

Once you have an initial backup in place, put this in your cron job to run daily.

Note on Passwords
=================
*There is no mechanism for recovering a lost password.  If you lose it, you're done.*

Passwords can be changed with the sonic utility.

All client tools take a couple of password options.  `--password` or `-P` will allow you to specify a password on the command line, or if no password is specified, it will prompt you to enter one.  The second option is `--password-file` or `-F`, in which case you can specify a path to the file containing the password in plaintext.  The path can be either a file path (relative or absolute) on the current system, or a URL of a remote file (file:, http:, https:  or ftp:).  A third option is `--password-prog`, after which you can specify a program command line to generate a password.  The program should output the password to standard output, and the first line will be read and used as the password.

Tardisfs supports all the same options, with slightly different syntax.  All are specified via the -o syntax to fuse mount.  `-o password=*password*` will use *password* as the password, `-o password=` will prompt for a password, `-o pwfile=*path*` will read the password from *path* (which accepts the same options as `--password-file` above), and `-o pwprog=*program*` will run *program*, same as `--password-prog` above.

Listing Versions of Files Available
===================================
Files can be listed in the `tardisfs`, or via the `lstardis` application.

`lstardis` can list all versions of a file available.  See `lstardis -h` for details.

Comparing versions of files
===========================
`tardiff` can directly compare two versions of a file in the database, or a file in the database, and it's corresponding version
in the filesystem.

See `tardiff -h` for details.

Recovering Files
================
Files can be recovered in two different ways: via the `regenerate` application, and via a `tardisfs` filesystem.

The filesystem approach is often the easiest method.  In this technique, a filesystem is mounted which contains the results of all the backupsets.  At the top level, there is a directory for each backup set.  Underneath these directories, are the full image of the backuped directories in a standard directory tree, as they appeared at the time of the backup.  Files can easily be copied out of this tree to their desired locations.

Files can also be recovered via the regenerate application. The regenerate application takes the name of the file to be recovered, and can also be given a date for which to regenerate the file.  Dates can be via the --date (-d) option, and can be specified via a large variety of forms.  For instance `regenerate -d '3 days ago' filename` will regenerate a version from 3 days earlier.  Dates can also be specified expclitly in a wide variety of formats, such as "03/15/2014" to specify March 15, 2014 (obviously).

Regenerate can be used to recover entire directory trees.  In general, using regenerate to recover files will be siginicantly faster than rsync'ing out of tardisfs.

See `regenerate -h` for details.

At present, the regenerate application does NO permission checking to determine if a user has permission to read a file.  Thus, any file in the database set can be accessed by anybody with access to the backup database.  If this is a problem in your environment, it is recommended to disable the regenerate application (or at least protect the database with a password that you don't share with all users), and allow access primarily through a tardisfs filesystem controlled by the super-user.  See Mounting the Filesystem below.

Utility Functions
=================
The sonic program is useful for manipulating a backup.  Sonic provides various functions whch don't fit well elsewhere.
These include:
   * create -- Create a new backup (can only be run on the server machine)
   * setpass -- Set a password into a backup.  Note, this will not encrypt any current contents of the backup.
   * chpass -- Change the password of a backup.
   * keys -- Extract or insert the encyrption keys of an encrypted backup.
   * list -- List all backup sets.
   * files -- Print a list of files that were updated in a specified backup set.
   * info -- Print information about each backup set.  Very slow, not recommended (deprecated)
   * purge -- Purge old backup sets, based on the criteria presented.
   * delete -- Delete a specific backup set.
   * orphans -- Purge out orphanned data in the backup set.  Can be very slow running.
   * getconfig -- Get a server side configuration value, or all values.
   * setconfig -- Set a server side configuration value.
   * upgrade -- Upgrade the database to the current version.

These options are available as subcommands, for instance:
    sonic list <options>
Each subcommand takes a different set of options, although many are common.

System Defaults
---------------
The above environment variables can have default values set via the system defaults file.  This file is located at /etc/tardis/system.defaults, or can be overridden by the TARDIS_DEFAULTS environment variable.
The system.defaults file is not installed by default.

Format is a standard .ini file, with variables in the Tardis section, and each variable specified with the names in the table above.

The location of the defaults files can be overridden by the TARDIS_DEFAULTS environment variable.

Configuration
=============
All applications in the Tardis suite can take options from multiple locations.  These locations are, in order:
the default value, the system default, the configuration file, and the command line.
Thus, the system default overrides the built in default, the configuration overrides either of those, and the command line arguments
override all of the other options.  Note that some options can only be specified on the command line.

Command line arguments for many tools can be specified in a file, accessed via the @ symbol.  For instance 
    tardis @file -list
will read _file_ as if it were arguments presented on the command line.

Client Configuration Files
==========================
Client tools can read from multiple configuration files.
By default, configurations are read from Tardis section, but can be overridden by using the --job option.

The server configuration file, usually in /etc/tardis/tardisd.cfg, is in the standard .ini file format.  There is a single section, "[Tardis]", containing all the variables.  The following configuration variables are defined:

| Name            | Default Value       | Environment Var | Definition |
| ---             | ------------        | --------------- | ---------- |

Mounting the filesystem
=======================
The backup sets can be mounted as a filesystem, thus:
   tardisfs -o database=/path/to/database [-o host=hostname] [-o password=[your_password]] mountpoint
/path/to/the/backup/directory will be the path specified in the BaseDir in the server host config.  The host parameter is the name of the host that you wish to mount backups for.

Password should only be set if a password is specified in the backup.  If you leave it blank (ie, password=), it will prompt you for a password during mount.

tardisfs options are specified in a format to enable fstab mounting.  Each option is specified as `-o name=value`.  For instance, `-o database=/nfs/tardis -o client=hostname`.  Options can be specified in a fstab, such as:
```
tardisfs#0				/mnt/tardis/ClientName	fuse	user,noauto,default_permissions,allow_other,database=/nfs/tardis/,client=ClientName	0 2
```

Due to the nature of FUSE filesystems, allowing any user to mount the filesystem can create a potential security hole, as most permissions are ignored.  The most effective way to perserve some security is to mount the filesystem as root, with the "-o allow_other -o default_permissions" options specified.  This allows all users to access the file system, and enforces standard Unix file permission checking.

Encrypting an Unencrypted Backup
================================
If you've built an unencrypted backup, and wish to add encryption, this can be accomplished, primarily using the encryptDB.py application in the tools directory.  Note, this is only semi-debugged.  Use at your own risk.

The following steps should be performed:
   * Add a password to the database:
      * `sonic setpass [-D /path/to/database] [-C client] [--password [password]| --password-file path | --password-prog program] [--crypt scheme]`
   * Encrypt the filenames.  **This step must be performed only once, unless it fails.  It should either encrypt all the filenames, or none.  If executed more than once, it will gladly doubly encrypt the passwords.  This can be a mess.**
      * `python tools/encryptDB.py [-D /path/to/database] [-C client] [--password [password]| --password-file path | --password-prog program] --names`
   * Generate new directory hashes.  This step is optional, but will improve performance (and database size) on the next backup.  If interrupted, this step can be restarted.  It will regenerate any information already calculated, but this is fine, just slow.
      * `python tools/encryptDB.py [-D /path/to/database] [-C client] [--password [password]| --password-file path | --password-prog program] --dirs`
   * Encrypt the files.  This step can be run multiple times, and will only encrypt files which have not been encrypted already, and thus restarted.  It *SHOULD* leave the backup in a consistent state if you cancel out, but again, use at your own risk.  This takes a LONG time.  During this phase, the database should still be accessible, but some data is encrypted and some is not.  This should be transparent to any users.  You *should* even be able to run backups while this takes place.
      * `python tools/encryptDB.py [-D /path/to/database] [-C client] [--password [password]| --password-file path | --password-prog program] --files`
   * Generate new metadata files.  This is optional, but can be useful should the database become corrupted.  This also takes a LONG time, but can be run entirely transparently to any other activities.
      * `python tools/encryptDB.py [-D /path/to/database] [-C client] [--password [password]| --password-file path | --password-prog program] --meta`

You can run all the steps at once with the --all option.  **As with --names, do NOT run this more than once.**  If it fails, restart the other stages as appropriate.
  
Release Notes -- Version 1.6
============================
Version 1.6 introduces User and Group tables.  These store the User and Group info by name, rather than just UID/GID.   The reason for this is that when you
rebuild a system, you may recreate the users and groups with different ID's.   Most likely you will create users and groups with the same names.  This makes
the User and Group information persist across the reconfiguration.  If you do recreate the users/groups with the same ID's, this won't really change anything.

When upgrading to version 1.6 it recommended that you upgrade the database schema manually, via:
    sonic upgrade
When this completes, run the tool "editUserGroup.":
    tools/editUpserGroupInfo.py -u -g
This will present you with a screen like:
    --------------------------
    --- Editing User Names ---
    --------------------------
    Key : System Name          Current Name
       1: root
       2: kolding              27a91ab627fde9160594059010b28af47913a2
       3: squeezeboxserver     bde976eaca2a4965395f6df720a9e1469fd553
       4: tardis               50c6a3306126e87c2b8eebcc9bc39a7b1dd7a2
    Line to edit (S to use all system names, C to use all current names, Q to quit, W to write and quit):
Selecting S will usually upgrade all the names, although if ID's have changed, you may edit individual entries.

If you don't do this, ongoing backups will still work.   Previous backups will still exist, but may have trouble either recovering the user/group
info, or setting it.

Release Notes -- Version 1.1.5
==============================
1.1.5 changes the way directory hashes are generated.   Prior to this, hashes were based on the encrypted file names.   This caused a significant performance hit, as the filenames all had to be encrytped,
taking up most of the runtime of an incremental backup.   1.1.15 changes this so that the hashes are generated based on the original filenames.
This will cause a significant performance increase, but on the first backup after the upgrade, it will cause all directory hashes to be incorrect.
New hashes will be generated automatically, but if you wish, you can generate new hashes using the `tools/setDirHashes.py` script, or with `encryptDB.py --dirs`).
This only impacts encrypted backups.   Unencrypted backups will see no difference.


Release Notes -- Version 1.1.2
==============================
1.1.2 adds a several bug fixes, and a couple minor features.  The most visible feature is the addition of path matching in exclude files.   Patch matching uses the \*\* wildcard, and follows
the GIT WildMatch syntax.

Changes in behavior include:
   * tardisd and tardisremote no longer include the configuration files from /etc/tardis/ by default.   These need to be specified on the command line.
   * tardisd and tardisremote now attempt to read their data from the `Daemon` and `Remote` sections of their config files respectively, allowing a combined config file for both.   Defaults are read
     from the `Tardis` section, allowing current configuration files to be used unchanged.
   * tardis now uses the -Y option for message compression.   -C is now a shortcut for --client, to be compatibile with other tools.

Important Note -- Version 1.1.0
===============================
The 1.1.x releases for Python3 are mildly incompatible with the 1.0.x releases.   The incompatibility is in the communications protocol between the tardis client, and the tardisd server.
Both need to be at the same release.  A 1.0.x client can't backup to a 1.1.x server, nor can a 1.1.x client backup to a 1.0.x server.

However, the remainder of the tools are compatible.   lstardis, regenerate, tardisfs, tardiff, sonic, and tardisremote can are all compatible.   You can use either the 1.0.x or 1.1.x tools to
monitor the same data.

The database schema is also completely compatible.   Data entered into a database under the 1.0.x branches can be continued to be updated by the 1.1.x branches.

As such, it is recommended that you update both clients and servers to the 1.1.x versions at the same time, to allow ongoing backups to continue.

Important Note -- Version 0.33
==============================
New clients must be created with the `tardis --create` or `sonic create` options.
If a password is required, tardis will prompt for one.

0.33's communications protocol is slightly incompatible with previous versions.   Please upgrade both client and server simultaneously.

Important Note -- Version 0.32
==============================
Version 0.32 changes the communications protocol in some minor ways, but is incompatible with previous versions.  The client, server, and all tools must be upgraded
at the same time.

Version 0.32 also changes the login mechanism, from the rather insecure ad-hoc mechanism used previously, to an cryptographically secure version, using
the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol.  As such, the database must be changed to support the new password mechanism.  The script tools/setSRP.py will
set the database up for the new password mechanism.  Note that this MUST be run on the server, and requires the users password.  Usage is:
   * `python tools/setSRP.py [-D cache] [-C client] --password [password]|--password-file file|--password-prog program`

Because the database schema updates at the same point, you will also need to upgrade the schema.  The command for this is:
   * `sonic upgrade -D cache -C client`

Note that no password is needed.

If your backup does not use a password, this step should be skipped.  It only applies to secure backups.

Important Release Notes
=======================
0.31.12 or so changed the database journalling scheme to SQLite's "write ahead logging".  This seemed to cause problems.  If you are unable to do much with the database, execute the following command at the command line:
   * ` % sqlite3 path/to/database/tardis.db`
   * `sqlite> pragma journal_mode=truncate;`

Post 0.31.11 changes the directory hashing scheme.  It is recommended that you run the `tools/setDirHashes.py` program (or run `encryptDB.py --dirs`, but only if your database is encrypted) to reset the hashes to the new scheme.  This is not necessary, but without it your next backup job will run *MUCH* longer than usual.  It will self correct after the first backup run.

Logwatch Support
================
Basic logwatch support is available in the logwatch directory.  You have to install these files by hand, no support is in setup.py yet.

MacOS X Support
===============
I'm in the early stages of testing Tardis on MacOS X, but it appears that, for the most part, it works, at least the client.

Note, you need to use the [homebrew](http://brew.sh "Homebrew") to install Python, and librsync.

Preliminary experiments indicate that it works on Yosemite, and Mojave, and should work on most versions of MacOS X.

`tardisfs` does not currently work on MacOS, as FUSE isn't natively supported.   In theory it should work with MacFUSE, but I haven't tried.

Installation on Mac OS X
------------------------
In most case, MacOS is case insensitive.   Getting Tardis from git can be problematic, as there is a directory Tardis
and a file tardis.   The latter is not necessary, so the best approach is to download the zip file from github,
unzip it manually, and when it asks what to do, replace the file.
  * Install Homebrew
     * `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
  * Install librsync, python3
    * `brew install librsync python3 snappy`
  * Install snappy
     * `CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib" pip install python-snappy`
  * Install tardis
     * `python3 setup.py install`

I recommend doing all the above in a virtualenv environment until you're certain of the results.

Compression
===========
Current versions of tardis support the following compression algorithms: zlib (gzip) deflate, lzma (xz), bzip2, and zstandard (zstd).   The choice of compression algorithm is up to the user.
The compression algorithm can be specified as an argument to the --compress-data (-Z) argument.  If no compression is specified, zlib is chosen.   The compression algorithm can differ between
backup runs, and is handled transparently.

In general, zlib is the fastest scheme, but offers the least compression.   Zstandard offers slightly better compression, at a slightly slower speed.   bzip2 offers even better compression,
and lzma is the has the best, with lzma showing a significant increase in computation time.

In general, zstandard and bzip2 probably give the best tradeoffs between compression, and performance, with zstandard being faster, and bzip2 giving better compression.   lzma is probably too slow for general use.

Note that performance of any compression algorithm will be heavily influenced by the data being compressed.

Tardis will not attempt to compress certain types of files, which it views as already compressed.  Compressed file types include standard compressed files (zip, gzip, xz, lzma, bzip2, etc) and 
some compressed data types (jpeg, mpeg, mp3, mp4, flac, etc).    Additional types can be expressed via their mime type iin the `types.ignore` file.

Encryption
==========
Older versions of Tardis supported a single compression scheme.  File data was compressed with AES-256 in CBC (Cypher Block Chaining) mode, with a HMAC-SHA512 authentication code.   Filenames were
encrypted using AES-256 in ECB (Electronic Code Book) mode.   Separate keys were used for filename and data encryption.

Newer versions of Tardis support multiple encryption schemes.
   * AES-256-CBC/HMAC-SHA512 for file data, AES-256-ECB for filenames (the original scheme), PBKDF2 for key protection
   * AES-256-CBC/HMAC-SHA512 for file data, AES-SIV (Synthetic Initilazition Vector) for filenames, scrypt for key protection
   * AES-256-GCM (Galois Counter Mode) for file data, AES-SIV for filenames, scrypt for key protection
   * ChaCha20/Poly1305 for file data, AES-SIV for filenames, scrypt for key protection
   * No encryption

The original filename scheme was weak because ECB mode allows common sections of data to appear as the same value.   Thus, if two file names started with the same block of characters,
it was possible that both file names would be similar when encrypted.

Newer versions will use ChaCha20/Poly1305 as the default encryption.   On modern Intel x86-64 processors, AES-256-GCM may give better performance, due to the availability of specialized AES instructions (AES-NI).   On lower powered processors, ChaCha23/Poly1305 will generally give better performance.   Both schemes are believed to be cryptographically secure.

The encryption scheme can be specified when the backup is created at first, or when the password is set via sonic.  The scheme is specified via the --crypt option.  Specifying scheme 0 will create an unecrypted backup, with password authentication.

Protection Model
----------------
The Tardis encryption scheme is designed to protect against unauthorized viewing of data, but are not designed to protect you against an attack.
Simple checks on file data are made (via the HMAC, GCM, or Poly1305 authentication codes), but damage can easily be done by attacking the database.
In addition, some data of minor value (such as inode numbers) are stored in plaintext in the database, allowing possible reconstruction of the shape of a directory tree.
If the general structure of your data is known, Tardis may leak some information.

The system is designed so that the server never works with unencrypted data.   All encryption and decryption are handled by the client being backed up, or being restored.


Notes on Data Storage
=====================
Data is stored in a database directory on the backup server.  There is one directory for each client backedup, and named based on the client name.

Within this directory are several files:
*  tardis.db - A SQLite3 database containing the metadata of all the files.
*  tardis.db.{date}-{time}.gz - Several backup databases containing the last few database snapshots, in case the main database becomes corrupted.
*  tardis.journal - A text file containing enough information to recover the contents of various files, namely the hash value of the file, it's basis file (None if it is not a delta, otherwise the hash of the delta file), and finally it's initialization vector.

There are also up to 256 subdirectories, number in hex from 00-ff, containing the data.  Within these are a second level of subdirectories, which then contain the actual data.  The actual data for each individual file is stored in named with the hash value (either the MD5, or the HMAC-MD5, if a password is set) of the contents of the file.  The contents is the fully reconstructed contents, not the actual contents of the current file.

If the data is unencrypted, it is stored directly in the file, as either the raw data of the file (possibly compressed, if the client so specified) or as an rdiff delta.

If the data is encrypted, the above data is encapsulated in the following format: the first 16 bytes (128 bits) are the initilization vector for the encryption, currently AES-256-CBC.  After this comes the data, as above, encrypted.  In schemes one and two, which use an explicit HMAC, this data is padded ala PKCS#7, in binary.  The last 64 bytes (512 bits) of the file contain an HMAC of the data (including the PAD) using HMAC-SHA512.

Along with each file xxx, there is a corresponding file xxx.sig, containing the rdiff signature of the file, and a file xxx.meta, which contains information allowing reconstruction of the file (if not it's filename) should the database be corrupted.
